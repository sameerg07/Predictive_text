Just as Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel unified India by helping several princely states subsume into a common entity, the GST will bring economic unification.

But when the product goes out, we can see the inequality due to different tax regimes of different states. The same product will have different prices in, say Delhi , Gurugram and Noida which are 25-30 kilometres apart. This is because Haryana , Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have different tax regimes. As a result of these variations, a citizen wonders that - if I go to Gurugram I get the product at one price, if I go to Delhi I get the same product for a different price and if I go to Noida I get it for yet another price.\\n', '\\n', \"There was confusion in everybody's mind. The foreign investors used to be confused about different systems in different states. Today we are moving ahead to get rid of that situation. Arun Ji has vividly explained that once GST is in place, all sorts of taxes like sales tax, VAT etc. will cease to exist. Long wait by vehicles at toll plazas will end. Fuels worth crores of rupees are wasted. And that causes damage to the environment as well. Now we will be free from of all those troubles as the entire country will have a similar tax structure. Sometimes certain items, especially the perishable ones that were supposed to reach their destination in time, were delayed because of the time taken for processing; and it resulted in losses at both ends. Today we are getting rid of all that. The country is moving a step forward towards a modern taxation system. This is a system that is simpler, more transparent. It will help us curbing black money and corruption and reward honesty. It will generate interest and enthusiasm to do business honestly. It will bring in a new culture of governance. We have all lived tax terrorism and inspector raj. Today, due to the transparency of GST, due to technologically proven trial, grey areas are ending.

When they will get a single tax regime I can see clearly that whatever deficiency is there those will be removed and this art of the country will move ahead. All the states of India will get equal opportunity for development. GST is like our Railways. Railway is run by the Centre and the states together. Yet we look at it as Indian Railways. The officers of central services are posted both at the Centre and in the states yet they work in unison for India.

      " New Delhi:  Honourable President, Respected Vice President, Madam Speaker of Lok Sabha, our Former Prime Minister Shri Devegowdaji, Members of the Council of Ministers, all the other members of the House, and the esteemed conglomerate gathered here representing diverse sectors. In the process of nation building, we often arrive at a moment which leads us to a path breaking juncture and opens up a plethora of opportunities imploring us to aspire for new dreams. At the stroke of the midnight hour today, together we shall ensure a pioneering future of the nation. Within a few moments from now, our nation will embark upon a new economic regime. The entire 1.25 billion citizens of the country are a witness to this historical event. I do not believe that this process of GST is restricted to the scope of economy only. This momentous occasion stands today as a testimony to the concept of Co-operative Federalism in Indian Democracy. This hallmark day was possible due to the relentless efforts put in over decades by several stalwarts under whose guidance various teams developed this GST framework. It is overwhelming to see you all spare your valuable time to attend this auspicious occasion. I extend my heartfelt welcome and express my sincere gratitude to all of you for your august presence today. This path that we have tread upon, the direction that we have selected, the system that we have developed has not seen the light of the day because of just one team, or one government. This is a shared heritage. The combined efforts of all led us to this accomplishment. And here we are, unified, heralding the red letter day at 12 AM in this Central Hall. This is the same place which has been blessed by the footprints of many great national leaders. We are honoured to be sitting in the same sanctum. Let us reminisce the 9th of December, 1946 when this same Central Hall witnessed the first meeting to discuss the country's Constitution. Today we share the same place of pride. The front seats of this hall were ordained by the iconic national heroes like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Acharya Kripalani, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Sarojini Naidu.
